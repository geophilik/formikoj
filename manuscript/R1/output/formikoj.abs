We introduce here the open-source library formikoj, which provides a flexible framework for managing and processing geophysical data collected in environmental and engineering investigations. To account for the substantial changes regarding the market shares of operating systems within the last two decades, the library is specifically implemented and tested for cross-plattform usage.
We illustrate the applicability of the formikoj library to forward-model seismic refraction waveform data with the \texttt{SeismicWaveformModeler} based on a custom subsurface model and survey geometry.
Moreover, we present two case studies from seismic refraction tomography field measurements to exemplify the wide range of possibilities provided by the formikoj library for the processing of real data. In particular, we explore different visualization of the seismic traveltime readings to enhance their consistency prior to the inversion.
The low-level access provided by our library aims at giving the users the possibility to implement particular modeling, visualization and processing tools specifically designed for their objectives or other geophysical methods.
