We introduce here the open-source library formikoj, which provides a flexible framework for managing and processing geophysical data collected in environmental and engineering investigations. To account for the substantial changes regarding the market shares of operating systems within the last two decades, the library is specifically implemented and tested for cross-plattform usage.
We illustrate the applicability of the formikoj library for the forward modeling of seismic refraction waveform data with the \texttt{SeismicWaveformModeler} based on a custom subsurface model and survey geometry. We use these synthetic seismic data set to demonstrate the fundamental seismic refraction processing capabilities of the \texttt{SeismicRefractionManager}; thus, illustrating the ability to combine modeling and processing tasks in a single workflow.
Based on a 3D field dataset we present the available range of possibilities provided by the formikoj library for the processing of seismic refraction survey data. In particular, we explore different visualization techniques of the seismic traveltime readings to enhance their consistency prior to the inversion with the third-party library pyGIMLi.
The low-level access provided by the formikoj library aims at enabling users to implement novel modeling, visualization and processing tools specifically designed for their objectives as well as other geophysical methods.
