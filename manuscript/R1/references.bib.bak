  abstract = {In the broad spectrum of natural hazards, landslides in particular are capable of changing the landscape and causing significant human and economic losses. Detailed site investigations form an important component in the landslide risk mitigation and disaster risk reduction process. These investigations usually rely on surface observations, discrete sampling of the subsurface, and laboratory testing to examine properties that are deemed representative of entire slopes. Often this requires extensive interpolations and results in large uncertainties. To compliment and extend these approaches, we present a study from an active landslide in a Lias Group clay slope, North Yorkshire, UK, examining combined P- and S-wave seismic refraction tomography (SRT) as a means of providing subsurface volumetric imaging of geotechnical proxies. The distributions of seismic wave velocities determined from SRT at the study site indicated zones with higher porosity and fissure density that are interpreted to represent the extent and depth of mass movements and weathered bedrock zones. Distinguishing the lithological units was facilitated by deriving the Poisson's ratio from the SRT data as saturated clay and partially saturated sandy silts showed distinctively different Poisson's ratios. Shear and Young's moduli derived from the SRT data revealed the weak nature of the materials in active parts of the landslide (i.e. 25kPa and 100kPa respectively). The SRT results are consistent with intrusive (i.e. cone penetration tests), laboratory, and additional geoelectrical data from this site. This study shows that SRT forms a cost-effective method that can significantly reduce uncertainties in the conceptual ground model of geotechnical and hydrological conditions that govern landslide dynamics.},

  abstract = {The development and use of open-source software in geophysics over the last decade have grown considerably. However, there are few open-software alternatives for seismic methods and even fewer regarding seismic refraction data processing and inversion. We present Refrapy, an open-source package for seismic refraction data analysis written in Python, using some of the main libraries for scientific computing and geosciences. Divided into two main programs (Refrapick and Refrainv), it is possible to perform basic waveform processing, picking of first breaks, and inversion through time-terms analysis or traveltimes tomography, all with GUIs interaction. To evaluate and validate the products obtained using Refrapy, we analyzed sets of synthetic data and real field data. The calculated models recovered the geometry and velocities values of the actual synthetic models satisfactorily. The joint interpretation of the results obtained with both available inversion techniques permitted a more detailed interpretation. As for the analysis of real data, the results presented a compatible response compared to the model obtained by a well-established commercial software, satisfactorily representing the geological context interpreted initially. The software presented in this work is expected to contribute to the activities of researchers, practitioners, and students regarding the analysis of seismic refraction data as a free, open, and user-friendly alternative.},

  abstract = {Inverse modeling is a powerful tool for extracting information about the subsurface from geophysical data. Geophysical inverse problems are inherently multidisciplinary, requiring elements from the relevant physics, numerical simulation, and optimization, as well as knowledge of the geologic setting, and a comprehension of the interplay between all of these elements. The development and advancement of inversion methodologies can be enabled by a framework that supports experimentation, is flexible and extensible, and allows the knowledge generated to be captured and shared. The goal of this paper is to propose a framework that supports many different types of geophysical forward simulations and deterministic inverse problems. Additionally, we provide an open source implementation of this framework in Python called SimPEG (Simulation and Parameter Estimation in Geophysics, http://simpeg.xyz). Included in SimPEG are staggered grid, mimetic finite volume discretizations on a number of structured and semi-structured meshes, convex optimization programs, inversion routines, model parameterizations, useful utility codes, and interfaces to standard numerical solver packages. The framework and implementation are modular, allowing the user to explore, experiment with, and iterate over a variety of approaches to the inverse problem. SimPEG provides an extensible, documented, and well-tested framework for inverting many types of geophysical data and thereby helping to answer questions in geoscience applications. Throughout the paper we use a generic direct current resistivity problem to illustrate the framework and functionality of SimPEG.},

  abstract = {Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and induced polarization (IP) methods are now widely used in many interdisciplinary projects. Although field surveys using these methods are relatively straightforward, ERT and IP data require the application of inverse methods prior to any interpretation. Several established non-commercial inversion codes exist, but they typically require advanced knowledge to use effectively. ResIPy was developed to provide a more intuitive, user-friendly, approach to inversion of geoelectrical data, using an open source graphical user interface (GUI) and a Python application programming interface (API). ResIPy utilizes the mature R2/cR2 inversion codes for ERT and IP, respectively. The ResIPy GUI facilitates data importing, data filtering, error modeling, mesh generation, data inversion and plotting of inverse models. Furthermore, the easy to use design of ResIPy and the help provided inside makes it an effective educational tool. This paper highlights the rationale and structure behind the interface, before demonstrating its capabilities in a range of environmental problems. Specifically, we demonstrate the ease at which ResIPy deals with topography, advanced data processing, the ability to fix and constrain regions of known geoelectrical properties, time-lapse analysis and the capability for forward modeling and survey design.},

  abstract = {The disposal of municipal solid waste (MSW) in landfills is the prevalent method of waste management at the global scale. However, the production of landfill gases due to the methanogenic fermentation of wet MSW is a possible threat to human health and accounts for a substantial contribution to the global greenhouse gas emissions. Accordingly, information regarding water content is critical as it is an important factor triggering methane production in MSW landfills. In this study, we propose a petrophysical joint inversion scheme to quantitatively solve for the water content (WC) in landfills based on seismic refraction as well as electrical resistivity data collected at two different frequencies. In this way, we also take into account the contribution of the surface conductivity to the observed electrical response, which is crucial for a reliable quantification of the WC. Our results reveal a high water content within the MSW unit (WC > 20%) for areas characterized by a strong polarization response (normalized chargeability > 5 Mn mS/m). Such areas can be related to an increased biogeochemical activity as evidenced by the detected methane production. We observe consistent estimates between the water content resolved through the proposed joint inversion scheme and values measured in waste samples with a median percentage error of 17%. Our study demonstrates the possibility to obtain reliable estimates for the WC in MSW landfills through the petrophysical joint inversion of seismic and electrical data when surface conductivity is explicitly considered.},
