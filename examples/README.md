This folder contains the raw data files and complementary information required for the reproduction of the exemplary uses cases presented in the manuscript. The data are provided in the directory structure required for both testing the modeling and the processing capabilities of the 

* `modeling`: Information provided in the required directory structure to generate synthetic seismic waveform data with (`noise`) and without (`clean`) random and systematic errors.
* `processing`: Seismic raw data and survey information provided in the required directory structure to test the processing capabilities for 2D (`danube_island`) and 3D (`salt_lakes`) survey layouts.
