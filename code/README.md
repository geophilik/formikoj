# Source code of the formikoj library

The source code in `formikoj` is divided into `modeling` and `processing` functionalities as well as common utilities (`utils`) relevant for the entire library.

The `Makefile` automates all processes related to executing the code.
Run the following to perform all actions from building the software to
generating the final figures:

    make all
